# MRCC-Freeze-Maps-Climo
A public archive of the Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC)'s VIP Frost/Freeze Climatology Files from https://mrcc.purdue.edu/VIP/frz_maps/freeze_maps#frzMaps

Motivation:
On April 16, 2025, the MRCC sent out an email to external stakeholders...
"Unfortunately, it is looking likely that our funding will lapse tomorrow (April 17). At that time, our website and all of our hosted products on the website, including VIP Frost/Freeze Guidance, will be unavailable. The base RCC contract is what funded all aspects of the website from IT server usage, data storage, and personnel support."
